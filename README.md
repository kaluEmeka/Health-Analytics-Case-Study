# Health-Analytics-Case-Study
The Health Co analytics team have shared with us their SQL script - they unfortunately ran into a few bugs that they couldnâ€™t fix!  I have been asked to quickly debug their SQL script and use the resulting query outputs to quickly answer a few questions that the GM has requested for a board meeting about their active users.
